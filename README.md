# Pomodoro Timer
A simple and responsive Pomodoro Timer built with React.js and Tailwind CSS.

### Project Description
The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool that helps users manage their time effectively. It is based on the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique involves dividing work into 25-minute intervals, known as "Pomodoros", separated by short breaks.

This Pomodoro Timer application provides a simple and intuitive interface for starting, pausing, resetting and adding 5 minutes to the timer. It also displays the remaining time in a clear and easy-to-read format.

### Tech Stack
The following technologies were used to build this Pomodoro Timer:

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- JavaScript: A high-level, dynamic and interpreted programming language.
